# **Setup & How to Run**

This guide will help you set up and run the project locally.

## **Prerequisites**
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:  
1. **Node.js** 
2. **Ganache**
3. **Truffle**

## **Step 1: Clone the Repository**
Clone the project repository and navigate to the project directory:  
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd CS4207-project
```

# **Step 2: Get the Packages**

### Navigate to the `blockchain/` directory:
```bash
cd blockchain
```
From here, you may need to run
```
npm install
```
but if did lab sheet should be grand


# Step 3: Run everything :D
In the root directory run:
```
start.bat
```

Run the frontend and enjoy chaining blocks together.


## Extras

This just very basic so you can connect and send a messsage with blockchain. We will basically then need to configure this up with a spring boot backend as we said we would use java. Then link with frontend so then for example, if we are going with project I sent within discord we can have endpoints to upload notes leave reviews blah blah blah.
